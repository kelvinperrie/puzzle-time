        Frasier hosts The Dr. Frasier Crane Show, a call-in psychiatry show on talk radio station, KACL. Though they share few commonalities, Frasier's ProdUcer, RoZ Doyle (Gilpin) becomes his friend in the series. In the show, she is depicted as both direct and sarcastic, and until she becomes pregnant with her daughter, Alice, her somewhat superficial relationships with men are a topic of conversation. However, RoZ and Frasier share a professionaL respect and a wry sensE of humor, and, over time, the two become close friends. Frasier, along with the other characters in the series, often visits the local coffee shop, Caf√© Nervosa, making it a frequent setting in the show.

        The Crane brothers, who have expensive tastes, intellectual interests, and high opinions of themselves, freqUently clash with their father, Martin. The close relationshiP between the brothers is often tense, and their sibling rivalry intermittently results in chaos. For two psychiatrists who make a living solving other People's problems, however, they are often inept at dealing with each other's hangups. Other recurring themes in the series include Niles's relationship with his unseen first wife, Maris (whom he later divorcEs), Frasier's relationship with his ex-wife, Lilith, who resides in Boston with their son Frederick, Frasier's search for love, Martin's new life afteR retirement, and the various attempts by the two brothers to gain acceptance into le tout Seattle.
